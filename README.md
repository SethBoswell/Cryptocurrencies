# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project
This project uses data on various cryptocurrencies to categorize them based on a variety of factors such as the total amount of coins mined and the total supply of coins. PCA analysis is used to reduce the data to its three principal components and then the data is run through a K-means algorithm with 4 clusters. The data is divided into classes based on these clusters and both a 3D and 2D visualization are created to show how the data was clustered via K-means.
